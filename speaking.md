### Examples

> Do you prefer indoor activities or outdoor activities? Use details and examples to support your explanation?

**I prefer** outdoor activities **over** indoor activities.

**The first reason is**, I have a lot of energy. I have noticed that if I stay inactive for a certain amount of time, my body begins to shake, which means it is trying to release some energy, **so** `outdoor activities` allow me to release that energy.

**The second reason is**, I like fresh air. I begin feeling unwell if I do not go outside and breathe in fresh air.

**The third reason is**, I like to stay in shape, **so** `going outside and staying active` is a great way to keep my muscles strong and healthy.

```txt
According to the announcement/letter, <summary change>, because <summary reason 1, 2>.

The main speaker in the conversation strongly supports/rejects the idea.

She/He believes that <opinion 1>.

```

### Examples

> For the past few years, the daily campus newspaper has included a one-page international news section covering a few of the major stories in world news. Starting next month, the section will be eliminated. One of the reasons the newspaper editors gave for the decision to cut the section is that other news sources are better able to provide wider and more up-to-date international news coverage. The editors also noted that the change would create space for a new calendar page that will list events and activities around campus.

**According to the announcement**, university wants to eliminate international news section page from the daily campus newspaper, **they think that** other news papers are better sources for this kind of news as they are more up-to-date and contains wide range of news, **also** they think the freed space can be used as calendar page that lists events and activities around campus.

**The main speaker in the conversation strongly supports the idea**.

**She believes that** people are mostly aware of the international news before they check the daily campus newspaper, they use mostly internet and other newspaper which are more up-to-date and contains wider range of news.

**Also she believes that** using that page as a campus events calendar is a great idea, because most of those events are distributed around the university and people need a central area or page track those events.

[In the second example, <example 2>].
```

### Examples

> Although they may not realize it, people do not always manage their money in a responsible way. In their minds, people tend to divide their money into different categories as if they were putting it into separate mental bank accounts. This tendency is known as mental accounting. People mentally store some money in one account to be saved, while they imagine other money being stored in another account from which money can be taken and freely spent. Mental accounting can lead people to spend more money than they should, which can make it difficult for them to save enough money to achieve their long-term financial goals.

**The text explains the concept of** Mental Accounting, **which actually is** a tendency of people who want to manage their money in separate bank accounts, one account as storage and another for free usage. Mental Accounting may lead people to spend more money and make saving money difficult.

The professor clarifies this concept by providing one example about it.

He states that when he was younger, he has two separate jobs, he worked in office as his regular job in regular days of the week, also he worked as a waiter in a restaurant in weekends. he stores his money from separate jobs into separate bank accounts. Someday he wants to buy a house, he tried to earn money but he find out that he is only storing money from his main job bank account, but he could use his second bank account to buy the house faster.
